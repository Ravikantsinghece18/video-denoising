## Project Proposal

We want to do a project in object detection, which is a classical problem in Computer Vision.

In this project, we will try to implement and train various object detection algorithms from scratch and compare the results on multiple metrics among them. We have selected some of the state-of-the-art algorithms for our project in object detection such as R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN and YOLO algorithm.

The project will be in python programming language and will use the following libraries:-
1. Numpy
2. Tensorflow
3. Matplotlib
4. OpenCV
